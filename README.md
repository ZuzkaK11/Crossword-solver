# Crossword-solver
The "Crossword Solver" project, implemented in Python, solves crossword puzzles using CSP techniques, backtracking, and the MRV heuristic. It efficiently fills a 2D grid with words from a dictionary, ensuring valid placements. Key features include word preprocessing, heuristic optimization, and saving solved puzzles with performance metrics.
